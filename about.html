            <p><p>About Mukono Love Church</p>

                <b>Mukono Love Church</b> is a Christ-centered, Bible-believing Christian church located in Mukono, Uganda, 
                where everyone is loved, welcomed, and helped to grow in faith. We are more than a place of worship — 
                we are a church family committed to loving Jesus, loving people, and transforming lives through the power of the Gospel.
                
                Founded with a heart for people from all walks of life, Mukono Love Church exists to share God’s love, disciple believers, 
                and build strong families rooted in Jesus Christ. Under the leadership of <b>Ps. Kibuuka</b>, our Overseer and Senior 
                Pastor, the church has touched many lives, 
                including people with disabilities, through impactful programs such as the Night to Shine initiative. Our vision continues
                 to grow as we work toward acquiring <b>church land </b>to expand God’s work and reach more souls in Mukono and beyond.
                
                <b>Our mission</b> is to share the love of Jesus Christ, disciple believers, and impact our community with hope and truth. 
                <b>Our vision</b> is to raise Christ-centered believers who live with purpose, love deeply, and serve faithfully in this 
                generation and the generations to come.
                
                At Mukono Love Church, you will experience powerful worship, heartfelt prayer, and practical Bible teaching that 
                applies God’s Word to everyday life. We provide ministries for children, youth, families, and adults, including Sunday
                 worship services, <b>home cell fellowships,</b> discipleship groups, prayer and intercession, worship ministry, and community outreach.
                
                Whether you are new to church, returning to faith, or searching for a spiritual home, you belong here. <b>There is no dress 
                code</b> — come just as you are. From the moment you arrive, you will be warmly welcomed and supported as you grow spiritually in a 
                loving and friendly environment.
                
                We are conveniently located on the <b>2nd Floor, ABSA Bank Building, opposite KFC Mukono</b>, making us easy to access for individuals,
                families, and youth. For those unable to attend in person, we also offer online sermons, prayer support, and connection through our 
                <b>online and WhatsApp communities.</b>
